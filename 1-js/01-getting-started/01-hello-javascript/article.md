# Hello, JavaScript!

JavaScript was created in 1995 as a simple language exclusively for web browsers, to "make web pages alive". Since then it has greatly evolved, it's quite far from there it started. 

Today we can use JavaScript on many platforms:

- In a web-browser, by embedding it into a web page.
- On a general purpose computer or a server, using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and other means.
- ...Or actually on any device that has a special piece of software, called "a JavaScript engine". 

Technically, even a coffee machine can include its own JavaScript engine to allow programming of coffee recipes.

There's a formal language description called [ECMAScript Language Specification](https://tc39.es/ecma262/), it describes how a JavaScript engine works. Sometimes we'll give references to it, but, though technically correct, it's hard to read for humans.

Programs in JavaScript are called "scripts". 

**In this tutorial we concentrate on the "core" JavaScript, that works mostly everywhere.**

Then, after you're familiar with it, you'll be able to move in any direction: browsers, servers and so on.
